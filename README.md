<h2>Video calling app using webrtc with sfu backend (mediasoup).</h2>
<p>
    This app is all about random video calls (RTCPeerConnection instance) and creating private rooms (mediasoup) 
</p>

```bash
    I am using ws library for using websocket because i personally like it but there are some case in sfu where we to get back the data at the same place where will emit
    or send it and call another function to that data. so socket.io is recommeded earlier
    I am not aware about it and now its giving some errors.
